# MockUpProject

This is my second project for my Front-End Developer Techdegree through Treehouse. I was giving mock ups of what the web page should look like. Using a moblie first approach I used CSS to style the page for a moblie device first. Then, using media queries I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for tablets and desktops. 


This project passed with an Exceeds Expectaions on 11/04/2019.
# Overall Comments:
"Awesome job on this project! Your page is beautifully responsive and all of the required elements change flawlessly at each break point. You have shown a strong understanding of building an entire mobile-first, responsive webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. Keep up the good work and happy coding!"
