# MockUpProject

This is my second project for my Front-End Developer Techdegree through Treehouse. I was giving mock ups of what the web page should look like. Using a moblie first approach I used CSS to style the page for a moblie device first. Then, using media queries I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for tablets and desktops.
